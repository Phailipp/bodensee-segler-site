# Gjaidalm – Sources (placeholder)

This lake/region is added as a **minimal multi-lake proof**.

## TODO before real content
- Replace all `candidateUrl` placeholders with **real official sources**.
- Run `npm run verify:candidates` and only promote to `url/source/lastVerified` when the verifier passes.
- Remove all entries marked "(Demo)".
